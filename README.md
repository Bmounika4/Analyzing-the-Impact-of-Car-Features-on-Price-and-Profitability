# Analyzing-the-Impact-of-Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability
In this project, I am tasked with creating an interactive dashboard in Tableau to help a car manufacturer optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand. 

The dashboard will provide insights into various aspects of the automotive industry, such as the popularity of car models across different market categories, the relationship between engine power and price, the importance of car features in determining price, average prices across manufacturers, and the relationship between fuel efficiency and engine specifications.

-Business Objectives:
The primary objective is to leverage data analysis to inform pricing and product development decisions that maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand. By understanding consumer preferences, market trends, and the impact of different car features on pricing, the manufacturer can optimize its product offerings and pricing strategies to achieve competitive advantage and increase profitability.

By completing the tasks and building an interactive dashboard, I will provide valuable insights to the car manufacturer, enabling them to make data-driven decisions to optimize pricing and product development strategies. The dashboard will facilitate exploration of key factors influencing consumer demand and profitability, ultimately enhancing the company's competitiveness in the automotive market.
